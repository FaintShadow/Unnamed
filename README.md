# Unnamed
This is a 2D Platform game (if you can call it that). It doesn't have a name currently, because simply it's still not even ready. It is developed in Java with OpenJDK V21 using the library called [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). I have ideas I want to implement in this game but for now I just need it to have stable functionality. Like movement and collision.

Feel free to contribute. you can look at the [Examples](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) that Raylib provides to understand how this library works

**Goals:**
- Gorgeous world generation
- Entity movement
- Collision
